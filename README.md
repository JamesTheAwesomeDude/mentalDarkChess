An implementation of [mental poker](https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/pubs/SRA81.pdf) for [dark chess](https://www.chessvariants.com/incinf.dir/darkness.html)

-----

# Q

Can two players play the following variant of [correspondence chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correspondence_chess?oldid=5673559):

a. Each player can only "see" squares that their own pieces are attacking

b. A player who cheats and violates (a) by "peeking" cannot plausibly get away with it: he will at least be exposed by the end of the game

c. Neither player trusts any ["referee"](http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/darkchess.html) to *confidentially* administer the boardstate (though a loose-lipped-but-honest referee may still be got to adjudicate outcomes, especially after the match)

# A

I believe this is possible, and I will implement an example program to demonstrate it.

# Basic Usage

```shell
# Linux
sudo apt install python3-venv
python3 -m venv env/
(. env/bin/activate; pip install -r requirements.txt )
# If (though not only if) you're using something other than Ubuntu, you may want do do this differently

(. env/bin/activate; cd src
chesscolor=white python -m FogChess
)
# Or you can run python FogChess.py; whatever floats your goat

## DO THE SAME IN ANOTHER WINDOW: ##
(. env/bin/activate; cd src
chesscolor=black python -m FogChess
)
```

```cmd
REM Windows
REM idek how to set up Spyder or whatever- u on your own lol
REM if you have Python in your CMD, the following
REM should just work without issue:

python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
cd src
set chesscolor=white
python -m FogChess

REM DO THE SAME IN ANOTHER WINDOW:
cd src
set chesscolor=black
python -m FogChess
```

Also pass env `lol=555` if you want White to start out with the D and E pawns removed

# Development

Generate a release with the following scripts:

## Linux

```bash
set -e
python3 -m venv env/
. env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt
pyinstaller src/DarkChess.py
tar c -Jf "DarkChess-Linux-$(uname -m).txz" --strip-components=1 dist/DarkChess
```

## Windows
